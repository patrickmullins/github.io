  <h2>WDD 230: Lesson #2</h2>
  <h3>Principle #1: Hick's Law</h3>
  <p>Samsung</p>
  <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><B>Samsung Main page link</B></a>

  <p class="ex1"> I believe that samsung's website is a great example of hick's law. It shows it's featured products on the front page <br>
    if a user is not familiar with Samsung then this shows some of their best products up front. <br>
    Samsung also gives the users a choice to look a specific section of products that they make. <br>
    When you browse a specific section it gives you a focused group of five products from that sections as to not overwhelm the individual with choices.

   <h3>Principle #2: White Space</h3>
   <a href="https://www.apple.com/"><B>Apple Main page link</B></a>
   <p class="ex2"> Apple is a great example of the white space principle. They have successfully used white space to help make their design feel clean. <br>
    The images below show that there is a tiny bit of white space in between the different images on their website.<br>
    This helps the website to have a uniform and more seamless experience.

   <h3>Principle #3: Visual Hierarchy</h3>
   <a href="https://www.audible.com"><B>Audible Main page link</B></a>
   <p class="ex3"> Audible's website is a great example of Visual Hierarchy. The main page's color contrast brings you right to the focus point of their free trial. <br>
    This website uses a type of visual hierarchy with harnessing different typefaces. That way they can give an importance and order with the information presented on the page.</p>
