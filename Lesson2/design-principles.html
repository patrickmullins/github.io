  <h3>Principle #1: Hick's Law</h3>
  <p>Samsung</p>
  <li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><b>Samsung Main page link</b></a></li>

  <p class="ex1"> I believe that samsung's website is a great example of hick's law. It shows it's featured products on the front page <br>
    if a user is not familiar with Samsung then this shows some of their best products up front. <br>
    Samsung also gives the users a choice to look a specific section of products that they make. <br>
    When you browse a specific section it gives you a focused group of five products from that sections as to not overwhelm the individual with choices.

   <h3>Principle #2: White Space</h3>
   <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-12/"><B>Apple Main page link</B></a></li>
   <p class="ex2"> Apple is a great example of the white space principle. They have successfully used white space to help make their design feel clean. <br>
    The images below show that there is a tiny bit of white space in between the different images on their website.<br>
    This helps the website to have a uniform and more seamless experience.
